The DNA project usually revolves around analyzing DNA sequences to identify similarities, mutations, or patterns for various applications such as genetic research, forensics, or medical diagnostics.

A typical project might involve:

DNA Sequence Input: Accepting DNA sequences, represented by strings of nucleotides (A, T, C, G).
Matching/Comparison: Comparing DNA sequences to detect similarities or align them for understanding genetic relationships.
Mutation Detection: Identifying differences (mutations) between sequences to study evolutionary changes or genetic disorders.
Visualization: Representing sequences or results using tools like graphs or charts for better insights.
Applications: Using the analysis for solving real-world problems, such as identifying hereditary diseases, ancestry determination, or criminal identification in forensic studies.
